Ronin is a strongly typed MVC web framework for the [Gosu](http://gosu-lang.org) programming
language.  It integrates seamlessly with (but can be used independently of) Tosa, a Gosu-based object-relational
mapping layer.
 
## Ronin
Ronin is a Model/View/Controller-based web framework featuring full type safety. Links
between pages in a Ronin application are checked at compile-time, which means no broken
links - by using a modern IDE like Eclipse, you can catch configuration errors and
regressions right away, saving you valuable testing and debugging time. And configuring a
Ronin application is done purely with Gosu code - no magic and no XML files, which makes
debugging easier.

## Tosa
Tosa is a zero-configuration object-relational mapping layer, allowing you to query and 
update SQL databases using an intuitive object-oriented model. It uses Gosu's open type 
system to generate Gosu types based on your existing database schema, so there's no 
configuration required - your tables and columns become Gosu objects and properties 
automatically.
