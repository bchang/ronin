RoBlog is a simple blogging application using Ronin and Tosa. If you'd like
to see these systems in action, and see how they integrate together for an
easy, low-configuration, type-safe application development framework, you can
download RoBlog via the "Downloads" link from the main page of this repository. It's written entirely in Gosu, so you can inspect the
source to see how it works with Ronin and Tosa; its source is also included
in Ronin's source repository. By default, the "admin" user's password is "password".
